# Lab5_FaceDetection
Face detection of faculty
AIM:
To detect faces from a group image, extract color-based features (hue and saturation), cluster using KMeans, and classify a template face (shashi tharoor) into one of the clusters.

METHODOLOGY:
a) Face Detection
b) Feature Extraction (hue and saturation)
c) Clustering (using Kmeans and visualizing it)
d) Template Classification (classifying shashi tharoor face based on his hue and saturation)
e) Assign to nearest cluster

KEY FINDINGS:
a) Haar Cascade can detect faces.
b) Hue and saturation gives good separation in faces.
c) Kmeans effectively grouped similar faces

CONCLUSION:
Color based features combined with K-Means clustering can perform basic face grouping and classification.
